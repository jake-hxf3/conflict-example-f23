Merge conflicts, DO nOt fear them!!!!

This is content that was defintely added through the GitHub interface, or is it?. I am not certainly causing a merge conflict.

Thid sentefnce was addefffffd locally.

This is a repo that is used, in class, to demonstrate how to solve a merge conflict when it occurs with your teammates, or is it?. Sometimes Github will automatically solve the issue, other times it cannot and requires human intervention. Is Inception Real???
